**The Project**

This project aims to create a Face Mask Detection Dataset by sourcing from other datasets, as a requirement for the partial completion of the course System Integration and Architecture 2 (IT0129) in FEU Institute of Technology.

**Descriptions of each class type (will reflect those in the generated versions)**

mask_proper - refers to masked faces wherein masks are worn properly
mask_improper - refers to masked faces wherein masks are worn improperly *(e.g., uncovered portions of the face like a significant portion of the nose and/or mouth)*
mask_none - refers to persons not wearing any masks at all *(this may include persons whose face masks are dangling under their chins or over their heads)*

**Current status and timeline**

Data is still being added and annotated. More data are needed for the classes: mask_improper & mask_none.
